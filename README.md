# On the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors in Passage Retrieval for Spoken Question Answering

This repository contains resources for the paper[On the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors in Passage Retrieval for Spoken Question Answering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3511808.3557662). Georgios Sidiropoulos, Svitlana Vakulekno, Evangelos Kanoulas. In: Proceedings of CIKM. 2022

## Speech Data
We obtain the spoken version of the original textual questions, from MS-MARCO and Natural Questions, via Google TTS. The audio files can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/esYLF2TkfB0nEeB). Due to the large size and number of training questions in MS-MARCO, the data are split into multiple folders (each containing ~40K samples).
